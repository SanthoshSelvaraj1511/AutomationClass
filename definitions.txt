1)Class


  A class â€” is a template used to create objects and to define object
  data types and methods. Classes are categories, and objects are items within each category

2)Object

 A Java object is a member (also called an instance) of a Java class.
 Each object has an identity, a behavior and a state. The state of an 
object is stored in fields (variables), while methods (functions) display the object's behavior.

3)static

The static keyword in Java is used to share the same variable or method of a given class.
 
Static is a keyword (meaning that it has a special meaning for the compiler),
and it means that members of a class (a variable or a method) belong to the class itself. 
This means that you don't need to create an object to access a class member

4)constructor

A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. 
The constructor is called when an object of a class is created. it does not have any return type
